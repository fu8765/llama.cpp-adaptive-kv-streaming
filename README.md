# llama.cpp adaptive KV streaming - fork notes

This repository is a fork of
[RaymondHuang210129/llama.cpp-adaptive-kv-streaming](https://github.com/RaymondHuang210129/llama.cpp-adaptive-kv-streaming).

Upstream adds an experimental, block-granular KV cache streaming path to the CUDA
`llama-server`. With `--kv-stream-arena-mib N` the authoritative KV tensors live
in pinned host memory while one bounded CUDA arena is shared between
phase-specific compute buffers, resident KV pages, and the transfer ring. The
upstream README (linked below) covers that design, its build, and its benchmarks.

This fork keeps that implementation and adds speculative-decoding support and
memory management for the MTP draft context. Everything below is experimental.

## Differences from upstream

### Phase arena: speculative verify batches
- Upstream rejected generation batches whose token count was not exactly
  `n_seq_max` ("phase arena currently supports TG1 without speculative batches").
  Speculative decoding verifies `1 + n_draft` tokens on a single sequence.
- New context parameter `llama_context_params.n_max_spec_draft` ("max speculative
  draft tokens, 0 = none"). `common_context_params_to_llama()` sets it from
  `common_speculative_n_max(&params.speculative)`, so it follows the configured
  spec type (ngram, MTP, DFlash) instead of a hardcoded value.
- `llama_context::sched_reserve()` measures the token-generation graph at
  `max(n_seq_max, 1 + n_max_spec_draft)` tokens instead of `n_seq_max`.
- `llama_context::kv_stream_switch_phase()` re-reserves the decode layout at the
  same width, so the arena compute slab fits a verify batch.
- `llama_context::process_ubatch()` admits generation batches up to
  `max(n_seq_max, 1 + n_max_spec_draft)` and otherwise fails with
  "phase arena decode batch too wide".
- `n_max_spec_draft = 0` reproduces the original behaviour.

### MTP draft context
- The MTP draft context's `n_ubatch` is capped to
  `max(8, draft.n_max + 2) * n_seq_max` so its compute graph stays small.
  `n_batch` is left unchanged, because the Qwen3.5 MTP path runs a prefill
  catch-up decode into its own KV.
- The MTP context's KV cache can be allocated from a pinned region inside the
  target's phase arena instead of a separate full-length F16 `cudaMalloc`.
- The MTP block weights can be allocated from the same pinned region, so an
  evicted MTP context returns both its KV and its weights to the arena pool.
- A separate MTP-only GGUF can be supplied with `-md` while using
  `--spec-type draft-mtp`. The target then skips its embedded MTP tensors
  (`load_mtp = false`), and the draft borrows the target's LM head.

### New arena and context API
- ggml-cuda: `ggml_backend_cuda_phase_arena_set_pinned()`,
  `_reset_pinned()`, and `_pinned_buffer_type()`. The pinned region is
  bump-allocated from the top of the arena; the compute region must stay below
  it. The pinned buffer type shares the arena name so it is recognised as a CUDA
  buffer.
- `llama_kv_stream_pinned_buft()` returns the target context's pinned buffer
  type.
- New experimental context parameters: `spec_mtp`, `mtp_weights_bytes`,
  `n_max_spec_draft`.
- `llama_model_borrow_output()` lets a draft model share the target's LM head
  (`output` / `output_s`) instead of carrying a duplicate copy.

## Scope and status

- Validated on an RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB with Qwen3.8-27B, a Q8_0 K cache, a Q4_0 V
  cache, one server slot (`-np 1`), and Flash Attention enabled.
- Single GPU and `llama-server` only. The phase arena requires
  `n_seq_max == 1`, Flash Attention, KV offload, and a Qwen3.5-family target.
- DFlash2 requires a draft whose vocabulary matches the target. A
  condensed-vocabulary target (129006 tokens) is incompatible with the
  full-vocabulary DFlash2 draft (248320 tokens): the draft has no token
  embedding and embeds through the target's `token_embd`.
- ngram-map and ngram-simple currently produce zero drafts in this configuration.
- Research code, no upstream guarantees.
